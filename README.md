My Dice App

This app was created as a tool to use for use with tabletop roleplaying games. It will take an action, a number of dice, and the number of sides, perform the roll and print to the page. If needed it can calculate damage from up to three sources simultaneously as shown below.

(Attack 1d20): 19 total ( 19 ) - 14:50:31

(Shortsword 1d8 + Sneak Attack 2d6 + Fire Damage 1d6): 15 total ( 3, 3 5, 4 ) - 14:51:48

Party treasure tracking is complete. It converts all coins into gold and displays significant items as well. Update party treasure as often as needed and whenever you need to divide everything up using the app. Finally, the previous round of loot will be stored just in case it needs to be referred to at a later time.

Next steps: 
	This app has borrowed the HTML and CSS from a free-source calculator app and my next step will be to add functionality to that calculator.
	Considering making something that automatically rolls attributes

Open issues: 
	When a field is left blank, should throw an Error. Instead it displays an empty string. (): 0 total ( ) - 15:0:0
