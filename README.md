 - My Dice App - 

This app was created as a tool to use for use with tabletop roleplaying games. It will take an action, a number of dice, and the number of sides, perform the roll and print to the page. If needed it can calculate damage from up to three sources simultaneously as shown below

(Attack 1d20): 19 total ( 19 ) - 14:50:31
(Shortsword 1d8 + Sneak Attack 2d6 + Fire Damage 1d6): 15 total ( 3, 3 5, 4 ) - 14:51:48

Next steps: 
	This app has borrowed the HTML and CSS from a free-source calculator app and my next step will be to add functionality to that calculator. 
	I will be adding a party treasure tracker that will store information about loot found on adventures; everything from gold and silver to significant items. This tracker will store the info in localStorage for later use and it will automatically calculate each person's share.
	Considering making something that automatically rolls attributes

Open issues: 
	When a field is left blank, should throw an Error. Instead it displays an empty string. (): 0 total ( ) - 15:0:0
