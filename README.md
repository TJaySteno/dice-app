# Player Character

## Dice tool
    This app was created as a tool to use for use with tabletop roleplaying games. It will take an action, a number of dice, and the number of sides, perform the roll and print to the page. If needed it can calculate damage from up to three sources simultaneously as shown below.

    (Attack 1d20): 19 total ( 19 ) - 14:50:31

    (Shortsword 1d8 + Sneak Attack 2d6 + Fire Damage 1d6): 15 total ( 3, 3 5, 4 ) - 14:51:48

## Party Treasure
    Party treasure tracking is complete. It converts all coins into gold and displays significant items as well. Update party treasure as often as needed and whenever you need to divide everything up using the app. Finally, the previous round of loot will be stored just in case it needs to be referred to at a later time.
		
## Test Function
    A feature for those, like me, that question just how random this dice app is. It rolls 9,999 20-sided dice, calculates the mean, median, and mode, and displays it for the user.

## Next steps:
	  Change dice tool to input box with buttons for common numbers for easier use
